Due to the large project size, you can direct download the project by following this link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/18GNlwmyPq_QluqMw6hMLVUIr313RZ8x1/view?usp=sharing
Link to a short demo : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VLudK7kvtxjiHhHXAlzCid-6ZcN9gJAb/view?usp=sharing
Nonetheless, source code of the shaders and scripts will be added.



 
Known Issues(will be fixed at the next edition):
 1. Shadowmap is not been used to guide the light marching.
 2. Gaussian Blur diminishes the smoke's edges with the opaque geometry
